'''
You are given two positive integers n and k.

An integer x is called k-palindromic if:

x is a palindrome.
x is divisible by k.
An integer is called good if its digits can be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer. For example, for k = 2, 2020 can be rearranged to form the k-palindromic integer 2002, whereas 1010 cannot be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer.

Return the count of good integers containing n digits.

Note that any integer must not have leading zeros, neither before nor after rearrangement. For example, 1010 cannot be rearranged to form 101.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 5

Output: 27

Explanation:

Some of the good integers are:

551 because it can be rearranged to form 515.
525 because it is already k-palindromic.
