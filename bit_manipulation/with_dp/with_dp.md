Would you like full Python solutions and explanations for any (or all) of these problems next? You can also pick a topic (e.g., Trie-heavy, Bitmask DP-heavy, Contest-style).


Great! Let's begin solving the first few problems with detailed explanations and Python solutions. We'll cover them in batches for clarity.

---

### ✅ **Problem 1: Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array**

**Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums`, return the maximum result of `nums[i] XOR nums[j]` for any two elements.

**Concepts**: Greedy + Trie + Bit Manipulation

---

#### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Build a **Trie** from binary representations of the numbers.
* For each number, try to find the number in the Trie that gives the **maximum XOR** using greedy logic.
* The **greedy part** is choosing the opposite bit (e.g., if the current bit is `1`, choose `0` if available).

---

#### 🧠 **Why Trie?**

Because we want to find the number that differs **as much as possible** in higher bits, and a Trie allows **bitwise traversal**.

---

#### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # keys: 0 or 1

class Solution:
    def findMaximumXOR(self, nums):
        root = TrieNode()

        # Build Trie
        for num in nums:
            node = root
            for i in range(31, -1, -1):
                bit = (num >> i) & 1
                if bit not in node.children:
                    node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[bit]

        max_xor = 0
        for num in nums:
            node = root
            xor = 0
            for i in range(31, -1, -1):
                bit = (num >> i) & 1
                toggled = 1 - bit
                if toggled in node.children:
                    xor |= (1 << i)
                    node = node.children[toggled]
                else:
                    node = node.children[bit]
            max_xor = max(max_xor, xor)

        return max_xor
```

### 🚀 Coming Next:

* **Problem 2**: Word Subsets Matching (Bitmask + Trie)
* **Problem 3**: TSP with Constraints (Bitmask DP + Greedy Pruning)

Would you like me to continue with the next two problems now?

Great! Let’s continue with Problems 2 and 3, including detailed explanations and code.

---

## ✅ **Problem 2: Word Subsets Matching (With Trie & Bitmask)**

### **Problem**:

Given a list of `words` and a list of `puzzles`, for each puzzle, count how many words can be formed from its letters. Each word must contain the puzzle’s first letter and only use letters from the puzzle.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Convert each word into a **bitmask** representing the letters it contains.
* Only keep words with ≤7 unique letters because puzzles are 7 letters long.
* For each puzzle, generate all submasks of its letters.
* Count how many word bitmasks are subsets of the puzzle mask and contain the first letter.
* Use a **dictionary (hash map)** for fast lookup of word masks.
* Using tries can optimize but bitmask + hashing is usually enough.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
from collections import Counter

def word_to_mask(word):
    mask = 0
    for c in set(word):
        mask |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
    return mask

def findNumOfValidWords(words, puzzles):
    word_count = Counter()
    for w in words:
        mask = word_to_mask(w)
        if bin(mask).count('1') <= 7:
            word_count[mask] += 1

    results = []
    for p in puzzles:
        first = 1 << (ord(p[0]) - ord('a'))
        mask = word_to_mask(p)
        submask = mask
        total = 0
        while submask:
            if submask & first:
                total += word_count.get(submask, 0)
            submask = (submask - 1) & mask
        results.append(total)
    return results

# Example
words = ["apple","pleas","please"]
puzzles = ["aelwxyz","aelpxyz","aelpsxy","saelpxy","xaelpsy"]
print(findNumOfValidWords(words, puzzles))  # Output: [0,1,3,2,0]
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 3: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Constraints**

### **Problem**:

Given a cost matrix between `n` cities, find the minimal cost to visit all cities exactly once and return to the starting city.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Use **bitmask DP** to represent the subset of visited cities.
* `dp[mask][i]` = minimum cost to visit cities in `mask` ending at city `i`.
* Transition:

  * For each city `j` not in `mask`, update `dp[mask | (1<<j)][j]` from `dp[mask][i] + cost[i][j]`.
* Finally, return the minimal cost to complete the tour.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
def tsp(cost):
    n = len(cost)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    dp[1][0] = 0  # Start from city 0, only city 0 visited.

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        for u in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << u)):
                continue
            for v in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << v):
                    continue
                next_mask = mask | (1 << v)
                dp[next_mask][v] = min(dp[next_mask][v], dp[mask][u] + cost[u][v])

    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    return min(dp[full_mask][i] + cost[i][0] for i in range(n))

# Example
cost = [
    [0, 20, 42, 35],
    [20, 0, 30, 34],
    [42, 30, 0, 12],
    [35, 34, 12, 0]
]
print(tsp(cost))  # Expected minimal cost to complete tour
```

---

Would you like me to continue with the next batch (Problems 4 and 5), or focus on any particular problem?

Awesome! Let’s move on to Problems 4 and 5 with solutions and detailed explanations.

---

## ✅ **Problem 4: Maximize Score After N Operations**

### **Problem**:

Given an array `nums` of even length, perform `n` operations: in each operation, pick two numbers, gain `operation_number * gcd(num1, num2)`, and remove those two numbers from the array. Maximize the total score.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* We want to pick pairs to maximize the weighted sum of GCDs.
* Use **bitmask DP** to represent which elements are used.
* For each mask, select two unused elements, calculate gcd, and update the dp.
* The number of operations = number of pairs selected so far = `count_of_bits(mask)//2`.
* Try all pairs greedily by recursion + memoization.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import lru_cache

def maxScore(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(mask):
        count = bin(mask).count('1')
        if count == n:
            return 0
        op = count // 2 + 1
        max_score = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                continue
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if mask & (1 << j):
                    continue
                new_mask = mask | (1 << i) | (1 << j)
                score = op * gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) + dfs(new_mask)
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
        return max_score

    return dfs(0)

# Example
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(maxScore(nums))  # Output: maximal score
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 5: Palindrome Partitioning IV**

### **Problem**:

Split a string into 3 palindromic substrings by partitioning the string at two points. Return if possible.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Precompute a 2D table `dp[i][j]` that tells if substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
* Use **bitmask** or simple recursion to try every two cuts.
* Check if the three substrings are palindromes.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
def canSplitInto3Palindromes(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Precompute palindrome table
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                if length == 2:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]

    # Try all two cuts i,j such that s[0:i], s[i:j], s[j:n] are palindromes
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if dp[0][i-1] and dp[i][j-1] and dp[j][n-1]:
                return True
    return False

# Example
s = "abcbdd"
print(canSplitInto3Palindromes(s))  # Output: True (e.g. "a"|"bcb"|"dd")
```

### Next Up?

We can continue with problems 6 and 7 or focus on one of the previous problems to deepen explanations or optimize further. What do you prefer?


Sure! Let’s continue with Problems 6 and 7.

---

## ✅ **Problem 6: Remove Boxes**

### **Problem**:

You are given several boxes with colors represented by integers. You want to remove boxes to maximize points. Removing `k` consecutive boxes of the same color gives `k*k` points.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Use a **3D DP** with state `(l, r, k)`:

  * `l` and `r` are the current box range.
  * `k` is the count of boxes same color as `boxes[l]` contiguous on the left of `l`.
* You try two strategies:

  1. Remove the first `(k+1)` boxes and solve for the rest.
  2. Try to merge boxes of the same color inside `[l+1, r]` with those at `l`.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def removeBoxes(boxes):
    n = len(boxes)

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(l, r, k):
        if l > r:
            return 0
        # Optimize: extend the block of the same color at the start
        while l + 1 <= r and boxes[l] == boxes[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            k += 1

        res = (k + 1) ** 2 + dp(l + 1, r, 0)

        for m in range(l + 1, r + 1):
            if boxes[m] == boxes[l]:
                res = max(res, dp(l + 1, m - 1, 0) + dp(m, r, k + 1))

        return res

    return dp(0, n - 1, 0)

# Example
boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
print(removeBoxes(boxes))  # Output: maximum points
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 7: Count Ways to Assign Symbols (Target Sum)**

### **Problem**:

Given an integer array, count ways to add `+` or `-` in front of numbers to reach a target sum.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Use **DP** with **bitmask or hash map** to track achievable sums after processing each number.
* At each step, for each sum, we can add or subtract the next number.
* Use memoization or bottom-up DP.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def findTargetSumWays(nums, target):
    dp = defaultdict(int)
    dp[0] = 1  # One way to get sum=0 initially

    for num in nums:
        next_dp = defaultdict(int)
        for s in dp:
            next_dp[s + num] += dp[s]
            next_dp[s - num] += dp[s]
        dp = next_dp

    return dp[target]

# Example
nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
target = 3
print(findTargetSumWays(nums, target))  # Output: 5
```

---

Want me to keep going with Problems 8 and 9 next

Great! Let’s continue with Problems 8 and 9.

---

## ✅ **Problem 8: Bitmask DP - Number of Hamiltonian Paths**

### **Problem**:

Given a directed graph with `n` nodes, count the number of Hamiltonian paths starting from node 0 that visit every node exactly once.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Use bitmask DP: `dp[mask][i]` = number of ways to reach node `i` visiting nodes in `mask`.
* Transition: For each `j` not in `mask` with edge `i->j`, update `dp[mask | (1<<j)][j] += dp[mask][i]`.
* Initialization: `dp[1][0] = 1` (start from node 0).

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
def countHamiltonianPaths(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    dp[1][0] = 1  # start from node 0

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        for u in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << u)) or dp[mask][u] == 0:
                continue
            for v in graph[u]:
                if mask & (1 << v):
                    continue
                dp[mask | (1 << v)][v] += dp[mask][u]

    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    return sum(dp[full_mask][i] for i in range(n))

# Example graph adjacency list
graph = [[1,2],[2],[0,1]]
print(countHamiltonianPaths(graph))  # Output: number of Hamiltonian paths from node 0
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 9: Minimum Number of Refueling Stops**

### **Problem**:

You want to reach a target distance with an initial amount of fuel. There are gas stations at certain distances with some fuel. Find the minimum number of refuels to reach the target.

---

### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* Use **greedy + priority queue**:

  * Iterate through stations in order.
  * Keep track of reachable fuel.
  * When you can’t reach the next station, refuel at the station with the maximum fuel seen so far (max-heap).
* This approach combines greedy and DP logic efficiently.

---

### ✅ **Python Code**:

```python
import heapq

def minRefuelStops(target, startFuel, stations):
    fuel = startFuel
    heap = []
    stations.append((target, 0))
    prev = 0
    stops = 0

    for location, capacity in stations:
        fuel -= (location - prev)
        while fuel < 0 and heap:
            fuel += -heapq.heappop(heap)
            stops += 1
        if fuel < 0:
            return -1
        heapq.heappush(heap, -capacity)
        prev = location

    return stops

# Example
target = 100
startFuel = 10
stations = [(10,60),(20,30),(30,30),(60,40)]
print(minRefuelStops(target, startFuel, stations))  # Output: 2
```

Would you like me to continue with Problems 10 and onwards?


Got it! Here are solutions and explanations for the remaining problems (10 to 20) from the mixed bitmask DP + tries + greedy combo list:

---

## ✅ **Problem 10: Subsets With XOR Sum**

### **Problem**:

Count the number of subsets whose XOR is equal to a given number `K`.

### **Explanation**:

Use DP with XOR states. `dp[i][x]` = number of subsets of first `i` elements with XOR `x`. Update with including or excluding current element.

### **Code**:

```python
def subsetXORSum(arr, K):
    n = len(arr)
    max_xor = 1 << 10  # assume max XOR range
    dp = [0] * max_xor
    dp[0] = 1  # empty subset

    for num in arr:
        next_dp = dp[:]
        for x in range(max_xor):
            next_dp[x ^ num] += dp[x]
        dp = next_dp

    return dp[K]

# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3]
K = 0
print(subsetXORSum(arr, K))  # Output: count of subsets with XOR = 0
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 11: Word Search II (Trie + Backtracking)**

### **Problem**:

Find all words from a given list that can be formed in a grid of letters.

### **Explanation**:

Build a trie from the word list. Use DFS + backtracking on the grid to search trie paths.

### **Code**:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.word = None

def buildTrie(words):
    root = TrieNode()
    for w in words:
        node = root
        for c in w:
            node = node.children.setdefault(c, TrieNode())
        node.word = w
    return root

def findWords(board, words):
    root = buildTrie(words)
    result = set()
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

    def dfs(i, j, node):
        if node.word:
            result.add(node.word)
            node.word = None  # avoid duplicates
        if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= m or j >= n or board[i][j] not in node.children:
            return
        c = board[i][j]
        board[i][j] = '#'
        dfs(i+1, j, node.children[c])
        dfs(i-1, j, node.children[c])
        dfs(i, j+1, node.children[c])
        dfs(i, j-1, node.children[c])
        board[i][j] = c

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            dfs(i, j, root)

    return list(result)

# Example
board = [
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
print(findWords(board, words))  # Output: ['eat', 'oath']
```

---

## ✅ **Problem 12: Maximum Product of Word Lengths**

### **Problem**:

Find two words with no common letters and maximize the product of their lengths.

### **Explanation**:

Precompute bitmask of letters for each word, then compare pairs with no common bits.

### **Code**:

```python
def maxProduct(words):
    masks = []
    for w in words:
        mask = 0
        for c in set(w):
            mask |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
        masks.append(mask)

    max_prod = 0
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
            if masks[i] & masks[j] == 0:
                max_prod = max(max_prod, len(words[i]) * len(words[j]))
    return max_prod

# Example
words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
print(maxProduct(words))  # Output: 16 (abcw * xtfn)
```

from collections import defaultdict, deque

def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegree = [0]*numCourses
    for u, v in prerequisites:
        graph[v].append(u)

## ✅ **Problem 14: Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array (Trie)**

### **Problem**:

Find max XOR of any two numbers in an array.

### **Explanation**:

Build binary trie of numbers; for each number try to maximize XOR by traversing opposite bits.

### **Code**:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}

def findMaximumXOR(nums):
    root = TrieNode()
    for num in nums:
        node = root
        for i in reversed(range(31)):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            if bit not in node.children:
                node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[bit]

    max_xor = 0
    for num in nums:
        node = root
        cur_xor = 0
        for i in reversed(range(31)):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            toggled_bit = 1 - bit
            if toggled_bit in node.children:
                cur_xor |= (1 << i)
                node = node.children[toggled_bit]
            else:
                node = node.children.get(bit, None)
                if not node:
                    break
        max_xor = max(max_xor, cur_xor)
    return max_xor

# Example
nums = [3,10,5,25,2,8]
print(findMaximumXOR(nums))  # Output: 28 (5 XOR 25)
```

## ✅ **Problem 15: Minimum Window Substring (Sliding Window + Hash Map)**

### **Problem**:

Find the smallest substring of `s` containing all characters of `t`.

### **Explanation**:

Use sliding window, expand and contract while maintaining counts.

### **Code**:

```python
from collections import Counter

def minWindow(s, t):
    need = Counter(t)
    missing = len(t)
    left = start = end = 0
    for right, c in enumerate(s, 1):
        if need[c] > 0:
            missing -= 1
        need[c] -= 1

        if missing == 0:
            while left < right and need[s[left]] < 0:
                need[s[left]] += 1
                left += 1
            if end == 0 or right - left < end - start:
                start, end = left, right
            need[s[left]] += 1
            missing += 1
            left += 1

    return s[start:end]

# Example
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
print(minWindow(s, t))  # Output: "BANC"
```

## ✅ **Problem 16: Task Scheduler (Greedy + Priority Queue)**

### **Problem**:

Schedule tasks with cooldown intervals to minimize total time.

### **Explanation**:

Use max-heap for task frequencies, cooldown queue for waiting tasks.

### **Code**:

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter, deque

def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    freq = Counter(tasks)
    max_heap = [-cnt for cnt in freq.values()]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    time = 0
    cooldown = deque()

    while max_heap or cooldown:
        time += 1
        if max_heap:
            cnt = heapq.heappop(max_heap) + 1
            if cnt:
                cooldown.append((cnt, time + n))
        if cooldown and cooldown[0][1] == time:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, cooldown.popleft()[0])

    return time

# Example
tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
n = 2
print(leastInterval(tasks, n))  # Output: 8
```

## ✅ **Problem 17: Longest Increasing Path in Matrix (DFS + Memoization)**

### **Problem**:

Find the longest strictly increasing path in a matrix.

### **Explanation**:

Use DFS with memo to avoid recomputation.

### **Code**:

```python
def longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    memo = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]

    def dfs(i, j):
        if memo[i][j]:
            return memo[i][j]
        length = 1
        for x, y in [(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)]:
            if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and matrix[x][y] > matrix[i][j]:
                length = max(length, 1 + dfs(x, y))
        memo[i][j] = length
        return length

    return max(dfs(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n))

# Example
matrix = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
print(longestIncreasingPath(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

## ✅ **Problem 18: Alien Dictionary (Topological Sort)**

### **Problem**:

Given words sorted lexicographically in an alien language, find the order of letters.

### **Explanation**:

Build graph of letter order, perform topo sort.

### **Code**:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def alienOrder(words):
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    indegree = {c: 0 for w in words for c in w}
    for i in range(len(words)-1):
        w1, w2 = words[i], words[i+1]
        for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2):
            if c1 != c2:
                if c2 not in graph[c1]:
                    graph[c1].add(c2)
                    indegree[c2] += 1
                break
        else:
            if len(w2) < len(w1):
                return ""

    queue = deque([c for c in indegree if indegree[c] == 0])
    res = []
    while queue:
        c = queue.popleft()
        res.append(c)
        for nei in graph[c]:
            indegree[nei] -= 1
            if indegree[nei] == 0:
                queue.append(nei)

    return "".join(res) if len(res) == len(indegree) else ""

# Example
words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
print
```

Sure! Continuing from Problem 18 with full code and then Problems 19 and 20:

## ✅ **Problem 19: Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony (Tree DP + Combinatorics)**

### **Problem**:

Given a tree with `n` rooms connected by hallways, count ways to build rooms such that children rooms build after their parent.

### **Explanation**:

Use DFS to compute sizes of subtrees and multiply combinations (multinomial coefficients) of subtree sizes.

### **Code**:

```python
from math import comb

def waysToBuildRooms(prevRoom):
    n = len(prevRoom)
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(1, n):
        graph[prevRoom[i]].append(i)

    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def dfs(u):
        size = 1
        res = 1
        for v in graph[u]:
            sub_size, sub_res = dfs(v)
            res = res * sub_res * comb(size + sub_size - 1, sub_size) % MOD
            size += sub_size
        return size, res

    return dfs(0)[1]

# Example
prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
print(waysToBuildRooms(prevRoom))  # Output: 1
```

## ✅ **Problem 20: Largest Rectangle in Histogram (Greedy + Stack)**

### **Problem**:

Find the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram.

### **Explanation**:

Use a monotonic stack to track bars; calculate area when popping bars.

### **Code**:

```python
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    heights.append(0)
    for i, h in enumerate(heights):
        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
            height = heights[stack.pop()]
            width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
        stack.append(i)
    return max_area

# Example
heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
print(largestRectangleArea(heights))  # Output: 10
```
