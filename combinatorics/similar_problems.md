Here are **LeetCode problem numbers that are conceptually similar** to:

> *“Count number of ways from top-left to bottom-right of a grid moving only right/down while avoiding blocked cells.”*

These all revolve around **grid DP, paths counting, obstacles, or movement constraints**.

## 🔹 Core Direct Matches (Almost Same Problem)

1. **63. Unique Paths II**
   ➜ *Exact match*: count paths with obstacles, only right/down.

2. **62. Unique Paths**
   ➜ Same as above **without obstacles**.

---

## 🔹 Variations on Grid Path Counting

3. **980. Unique Paths III**
   ➜ Visit **every empty cell exactly once** (more constraints).

4. **576. Out of Boundary Paths**
   ➜ Count ways before leaving grid within `k` moves.

5. **1222. Queens That Can Attack the King** *(movement logic)*
   ➜ Grid traversal with blocking.

---

## 🔹 Advanced / Constraint Variants

6. **174. Dungeon Game**
   ➜ Grid DP with constraints and survival condition.

7. **120. Triangle**
   ➜ DP paths with restricted directions.

8. **931. Minimum Falling Path Sum**
   ➜ Grid DP with limited movement.

---

## 🔹 Counting + Modulo / Combinatorics

9. **2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid**
   ➜ Count paths with increasing constraint.

10. **1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost**
    ➜ Grid DP with transitions.

---

## 🔹 Graph / Grid with Obstacles

11. **1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix**
    ➜ Grid + obstacles (BFS instead of DP).

12. **1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination**

---

## 🔹 Bonus (Classic Interview-Type)

13. **64. Minimum Path Sum**
    ➜ Same grid movement, optimization instead of counting.

14. **221. Maximal Square**
    ➜ DP over grid with obstacles.

## 🧠 Summary Table (Mental Mapping)

| Problem | Key Idea             |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| 62      | Basic grid DP        |
| 63      | Grid DP + obstacles  |
| 980     | Must visit all cells |
| 576     | Paths with boundary  |
| 64      | Optimize path        |
| 1091    | BFS grid with blocks |

If you want, I can also:

* Group them by **DP pattern**
* Show **common DP template**
* Suggest **practice order**
* Provide **dry-run examples**

Just say the word 👍
