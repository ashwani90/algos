Absolutely! **Monotonic stacks** are a powerful technique used to solve problems where you need to maintain a stack with elements in a specific order (either increasing or decreasing). They are particularly useful for problems involving finding the next/previous greater/smaller element, or for optimizing certain types of queries.

Letâ€™s break it down with **explanations** and **examples**:

---

### **What is a Monotonic Stack?**
A monotonic stack is a stack where the elements are always in **monotonic order** (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). This property allows us to efficiently solve problems that involve finding the next or previous greater/smaller element in an array.

---

### **When to Use a Monotonic Stack?**
1. **Next Greater Element**: Find the first element to the right that is greater than the current element.
2. **Previous Greater Element**: Find the first element to the left that is greater than the current element.
3. **Next Smaller Element**: Find the first element to the right that is smaller than the current element.
4. **Previous Smaller Element**: Find the first element to the left that is smaller than the current element.
5. **Other Problems**: Stock span, largest rectangle in a histogram, etc.

---

### **Key Steps to Solve Monotonic Stack Problems**
1. **Initialize an empty stack**.
2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current element violates the monotonic property, pop from the stack and process the result.
   - Push the current element onto the stack.
3. **Handle remaining elements** in the stack after the iteration.

---

### **Example 1: Next Greater Element**
**Problem**:  
Given an array `nums`, return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the next greater element for `nums[i]`. If no such element exists, set `ans[i] = -1`.

---

#### Steps:
1. Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** (elements in the stack are in decreasing order).
2. Iterate through the array:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack, pop from the stack and set `ans[top] = current element`.
   - Push the current element onto the stack.
3. After the iteration, any remaining elements in the stack have no next greater element, so set their `ans` values to `-1`.

---

#### Code Implementation (Python):
```python
def nextGreaterElement(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    ans = [-1] * n
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[i] > nums[stack[-1]]:
            top = stack.pop()
            ans[top] = nums[i]
        stack.append(i)
    
    return ans
```

---

#### Example Input/Output:
```python
nums = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
print(nextGreaterElement(nums))  # Output: [5, 5, -1, 3, -1]
```

---

### **Example 2: Largest Rectangle in a Histogram**
**Problem**:  
Given an array `heights` representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed.

---

#### Steps:
1. Use a **monotonic increasing stack** (elements in the stack are in increasing order).
2. Iterate through the array:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current height is less than the height at the top of the stack, pop from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
3. After the iteration, handle any remaining elements in the stack.

---

#### Code Implementation (Python):
```python
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    n = len(heights)
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
            top = stack.pop()
            width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
            area = heights[top] * width
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
        stack.append(i)
    
    while stack:
        top = stack.pop()
        width = n if not stack else n - stack[-1] - 1
        area = heights[top] * width
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
    
    return max_area
```

---

#### Example Input/Output:
```python
heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
print(largestRectangleArea(heights))  # Output: 10
```

---

### **Example 3: Stock Span Problem**
**Problem**:  
Given an array `prices` representing stock prices, find the span of each stockâ€™s price. The span is defined as the number of consecutive days (before the current day) where the price was less than or equal to the current price.

---

#### Steps:
1. Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** (elements in the stack are in decreasing order).
2. Iterate through the array:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current price is greater than or equal to the price at the top of the stack, pop from the stack.
   - Calculate the span as the difference between the current index and the index at the top of the stack.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.

---

#### Code Implementation (Python):
```python
def stockSpan(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    spans = [1] * n
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and prices[i] >= prices[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
        spans[i] = i + 1 if not stack else i - stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    
    return spans
```

---

#### Example Input/Output:
```python
prices = [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
print(stockSpan(prices))  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Monotonic Decreasing Stack**:
   - Used for problems like "Next Greater Element" or "Stock Span".
   - Elements in the stack are in decreasing order.

2. **Monotonic Increasing Stack**:
   - Used for problems like "Largest Rectangle in a Histogram".
   - Elements in the stack are in increasing order.

3. **General Approach**:
   - Iterate through the array.
   - Use the stack to maintain the monotonic property.
   - Process elements when the property is violated.
